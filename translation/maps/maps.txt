So. How'd it all happen?
You remember it, don't you?
It's been so long. Practically a blur at this point...
Well... it all started with...
I over heard you talking to my brother.
You really just looking around?
Yes.
Alright... You can carry on.
I care about the Vultures. You think\#it's easy running a civil gang?
If we let one ass-wipe walk all over us that'll\#open the flood gates to us getting trampled...
...We're doomed.
This is why Claude is standing here with\#a lighter and an aerosol can in his pocket.
While I'm making marshmallows.
Want a marshmallow?
It's pure sugar.
Nah. I don't do well with pure sugar.
Oh come on. Live a little.
We're all running\#out of time anyways.
So why not enjoy it while you can?
He's... busy...
You looking to rob\#us blind, old man?
Maybe shank one\#of us while you're at it?
Do I look like a goddamn\#creep to you?
Tch,\. can never be to careful.
We've been getting alot of freaks and\#nobodies around here.\.\#Trying to steal our supplies.
Mess us up.
I'll let you loose.
But if I hear one complaint about you\#\.trying to steal shit from my Vultures\#I'll turn you inside out,\| you hear?
Yes, yes. I got it.
Ask about the Vultures
Ask about Mayo
Ask about Pineapples
Cancel
Who are you guys, anyhow?
I'm Claude Vulture.\#And we're the Vulture Club.
I helped found this little\#gang with my brother.
We scavenge around.\#Share food with one another. No big deal.
Which is why I can't stand those\#freaks during the blackouts \.trying to rob us blind.
I swear there they\#multiply by the day.
Hey. This is gonna sound weird.\.\#But uh..\| do you happen\#to have any mayonnaise?
Well. We HAD mayonnaise.
What?! What happened to it?
Relax, I just tossed it in a bin in the\#the trampoline land.
What?
Where the hell is that?
The entrance is around\#this cave somewhere, okay?
Now will you quit hounding me on it?
It smelled rancid anyways,\#so I'm not sure why you'd want it.
So uh, listen. I'm looking\#for some pineapples.
Know where I can find some?
Uhh...\| I think my buddy\#Dave found a can of it.
He's in the next cave over.
But don't get your adult diaper\#in a twist if he doesn't cough it up.
Alright. Thanks, I guess.
The drill goes\#drrrrrrrrrrrr...
Did you know that?
Our training is rigorous...
But it is necessary to\#build up out endurance.
And we must harness\#the gators power to\#overcome such catastrophes.
Such is the endless\#journey of the\#Gatormen.
I once read that gators\#even survived meteor\#that killed the dinosaurs!
Can you believe that?!
Now. Back to focusing.
You learned Dodge?!
I'm impressed an\#old man such as you\#managed it.
Goes to show the\#Master didn't just get\#his name for nothing!
The current Master\#was once a pupil\#like us.
But after our former\#Master passed,
he took it upon himself\#to rise above the rest and\#prove his worth as\#the new Master.
I can only dream to\#be as cool as that...
Mmm...
The alligator...
Nature's perfect beast.
The Apex. The undefeated.
Millions of years of\#evolution are wasted\#on its already perfected\#form.
We must strive to harness\#the gators' mighty power.
And become unstoppable...
There is much more\#to ponder on it's\#unique form...
But with the help of\#the Master, perfection\#is far from unreachable.
So you have consulted\#with the Master.
A wise choice. Use\#what he's given you\#well.
Become the apex.\#Become the gator.
Hm. Another outsider\#given the chance to\#learn the ways of\#the gator.
Do not waste it.
The Master has\#ascended to the\#position he has\#for a reason.
Do not heed his\#word lightly.
Lest you be\#clamped in\#his jaws.
You may have\#learned one of our\#moves, but you are\#still far from the apex.
We train and focus\#day by day on reaching\#the gator's perfection.
But no matter how\#close to perfection\#we may reach...
...we are still only human.
Do not let overconfidence\#get the better of you.
Otherwise you'll see\#just who the apex\#REALLY is...
Dad...
I didn't wanna go THAT far back, man!
How do you know all that anyways?
He told me this when we were at the bar.
Oh.\| Oh!\| Yeah, that I remember.
He was uh... he was... wasn't he robbed\#by some jackass or something?
Yes. When he was sleeping at the dam...
Use the shortcut pipe?
Yes
No
Uhhhm...\|\| Berny...
Do you see something?
I don't think so...
A-a-ah SHIT!
Is it...
The cave's collapsing!
We've got to get away!
Too late!
We were...\|\| I was really stupid.
Had I listened to Elton, we could've just\#told that guy about the demolitioners,
they would've just taken care of them\#for us; and none of this would've\#happened...
Still.\| Must of felt pretty good\#taking down a big fella like him,\| ey'?
It wasn't worth it.
So... the cave collapsed?
Yes, and when we woke up we\#were in the heart of it all.
I'll never forget the sight of\#those stalagmites.
The caverns were enormous.\#With stalactites above us was\#the size of trucks.
And far, far in the distance, through\#the mist, there was a blue glow lighting\#the whole caverns.
Woooaaah...\|\| sounds like a dream!
I thought so too at first,
but we soon realized...
Those stalactites weren't the only truck\#sized things down there with us...
WALKING:
Most people are\#born with legs.
And with any luck,\#you'll still have them!
But now's not the\#time to forget\#how to use them!
Just use those\#arrow keys and\#put your best\#foot forward!

SAVING III:
It's said\#that if a\#crow sees\#you once...
...it'll remember\#you for the\#rest of it's life!
So if you see a crow,\#you know they've got your\#back with a freshly saved game!
No consulting needed!
-Bird Watchin' Terry
Hey, anciano. You\#lost or something?
No. I got shit to do.
You uh.. you sure?...
I mean, you look\#like you could die\#to a stiff breeze, so...
I know\#what I'm\#doing,\#goddammit.
Alright, alright.\#If you say so.
Be careful out there,\#I hear the pots been\#stirred up out there\#if you get what I mean.
You found a stash!

Could you give it to me?
Huh? Why?
It's... My pet rock, Marcus.
Been searching for it for quite a while now.\#Glad to see it's alright.
Can I have it back?
So is it important to you?
Yes?...
Alright, listen here! If you don't wanna have\#your buddy thrown into a revine, you're gonna\#do exactly what I say!
Oh goddammit...
Fetch me a Super Doner and I'll give you your\#"pet" back!
A "Super Doner"?
It's a doner with pineapple and mayonnaise on it.
Who the hell puts that crap on doners?!
Your rat piss smelling rock is no better.
Okay...
But you better not lose... uh...

Hi there.
What a cruel death.
Hey...
Hey, old man, you want\#to look what I found?
Aw, fuck, man
lay off please.
Come on, I know you're\#gonna want it!
Oh, FUCK! What shit is this?!
It is a rock I found\#under an aged corpse.
You fucking lunatic!
Get away from me!

Oh, fuck you!
Come on! Rocks are\#good for digestion.
Okay, okay! You got it.
I have problems with it.

Here for a doner?
Of course you are.
It's all I am to you people.

Who makes doners.
Now leave me be.
Okay.
Man my tummy hurts so much right now.
All I had were a few doners.
Why must life be so cruel to me?
And ya Harry being dead is sad I guess.
But I bet HIS tummy doesn't feel\#like a miniature boxing\#ring of rumbles and pain!
It's a damn shame, really.
Harry deserved better then to be shanked\#during a blackout of all times.
Sorry about Harry, but do you know\#about the guy that killed him?
Haven't seen him around at all.
And what gets me the most\#is why he'd go and end his own\#life then and there like that.
Though to be fair, were he still alive,
I'd make sure his death would be\#far worse then what he got.
I never knew harry that well,\#but he was still a member of our\#little community.
And things won't be the same without him.
Man, wish Harry didn't die.\#Really sours my mourning meal, you know?
...are you serious?
DEAD serious. Heh.
But seriously just looking\#at his body almost distracts me\#from the taste of my delicious doner.
Almost.
I've had four of these bad boys already\#and I'm thinking of going in for five
Harry would want me to treat myself, after all.
Wish the ass hats\#around here would shut the hell up\#about Harry's death already.
Yes. He was killed.
That's a common occurrence these days.\#Get the fuck over it.
Honestly they needed something like this\#to relight the fire under their asses.
They've been having it to good for to long.
God, I've been too lenient with my work force.
Every other prick is either incompetent or stupid.
The brain dead moron above us\#has been beating his thumb more\#than the goddamn nail.
I swear: if I see one more worker of mine\#saw off a board he was standing on to his death...
...I'll loose it!
Oh Harry.. why did this have to be your fate?
Was he a good friend of yours?
For as long as I can remember.
He always wanted to live a simple life.\#Even after the flash.
Hey, uh. Sorry for your loss.
Thank you, stranger.
I guess we've just been living so good\#these past few years
we forgot it's still a waste\#land out there...
It'll be tough to move on\#after something like this.
But we'll make it through.
I'm gonna miss you, Harry...
This ain't good, I tells ya.\#Ain't good at all.

And I tells ya we gotta do\#somethin' about it and do it soon.

That could've been you!\#That could've been ME!
And his killer killed himself too?!
Nothing makes fucking sense!
We were living a quiet life!
We weren't bothering nobody.
So why did this have to happen to us?!
It's a tragedy what happened to Harry.
But what confuses me the most\#is Harry's killer here.
Plunged his own knife straight into his chest...
I recognize the bastard.
He robbed me of my\#belongings while I slept!
Did he try to fight back or anythin'?
Nah.
Just ran off as soon\#he saw I woke up.
Looked like he nearly pissed himself\#when he realized I was awake.
Odd...
I'm still not entirely sure\#what this could all mean.
But if more freaks like him show up\#then we might need to start\#packin' our bags...

Gah, what the hell?!
Alright! Now that we've got\#your attention, listen up!
We're the TNT Team,
the most dangerous\#and destructive group this side of Olathe!
However, these days\#we're running low on\#good cannon fodder,
so we're offering you fellas\#the opportunity to join our ranks.
You want us to join you?
Correct.
But if you refuse our generous offer,\#I've got agents all over the area\.\#to make sure you ain't leaving alive.
Now, what are your names?
Billy.
Jim!
You got their faces down?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Our base is located in the desert.\#You'll know it when you see it.
If I don't see you two there soon...
...consider youselves dead.
Man!
This seems like a lot of trouble\#to go through just to hire more men.
Be... Jim, please...
Don't fuckin' question me!
Mikey! Fire another warning shot!
AA-AAAHH\. shit!\| Mikey's dead!
God, fuckin...
Let's just go already!
And you, remember!\#Be by our base soon or\#we'll blow you to bits.
To hell with this.
Let's just go home.
But they've got\#agents and stuff, Elton!
They'll track us down for sure!
One of them accidently killed\#themselves trying to intimidate\#us.\| How "dangerous" can they be?
Come on.\|\| It's better\#to play it safe and\#just go to their base.
Which is in the goddamn\#desert, mind you!
And the only way\#to even get there\#is through the\#canyon pass up ahead.
Perfect! Then we'll\#be there in no time.
...Fine.\| If you're\#going, I'm going.
But don't say\#I didn't warn\#you when shit\#goes south, you hear?
They are dead.

See what?
Look up,\|\#up there.
I say, there is\#treasure above!\|\#But so far out\#of reach!
Don't you guys\#have any... ladders?
I say, we traded\#all for booze.
F\.f\.ffair trade.
I say, I heard long ago\#about using old rags to\#make trampolines.
I say, good show! Your\#ingenuity allowed you\#to retrieve that treasure!
It's mine now,\#so don't even\#bother asking.
Oh no, do keep it.\#You are its rightful\#owner!

So you've finally returned to us, Berny.
You betcha! And I've got\#what you asked for, too.
Show me.
You have lost The\| Infamous\| Nugget.
Amazing...
It still has the smell too...
So...\. Does that mean that the curse is gone?
With a nugget like this?
You've done more than we have asked.
The curse shall now be lifted,\#and for such specimen...
you shall be given an animal pelt.
You got a Raccoon Cloak.
Neat! Thanks for the magic!
You're welcome.
Also, tell your friend to stop\#grimacing at us.\#It's disturbing me.
Oh, sorry 'bout that.
We'll be on our way now.
The curse is gone.
Max HP and Magic Defence have been increased.
The blackout hit us Vultures so badly,\#I even lost most of my bones!
But I'm sure I have at least 3\#of them now.
Hehehehehe...
He...
He looks a little out of it.
Hey! Could you give me this can of pinapples?
What brought this on?
I...
My sick friend told me\#that he wanted to taste some sweet\#pineapples\. before he dies.

Some I cherish warmly.
But this fella right here?
This is a new one for me.
Can crows even\#drink alcohol?
And, like, get drunk?
See this, gramps?
This is what looks\#like to be alive.
Envious?
I'd be envious too if I were\#a sad sack of shit like you.
Hell yeaaaah!
Feel the rush!
Guh...
Smith just won't shut up\#about how "Oh when those\#two freaks show up!"
or "I'm gonna make em pay\#for what they did to Dale!"
and "I'll strangle em'\#with their own\#spines!"
I mean... like...
Shut the hell up, man...
Dale is a dumbass\#anyways.
Not sure why anyone\#would care about what\#happened to him.
Hey, heard some\#ruckus over there.
Everything good?
We shut Smith up for ya.
Heh. Nice.
Always knew that prick\#was all bark n' no bite.
Well.
Guess I'm out of\#things to bitch\#about...
This is a new feeling\#and I don't like it...
Keh-keh-keh...
Hey, grandpa.
I'll give you 10 mags and a knife\#if you get in that fight over there.
Yeah, that ain't\#happening.
Pussy.
You're no fun.
You better not have\#scratched our rides with\#your careless stumbling,\#old man.
Always some old fart\#around here that does.
Your 'rides?
Our\| bikes.
...you mean the damn\#children's bikes\#outside?
Screw you, gas is\#expensive.
Morons like them is why\#I always look forward to\#visitin' bars.
Love me some pointless\#violence.
If it weren't for Ricky having\#the time of his goddamn life\#back there,
I'd never come back to this stupid bar.
To many old grumpy\#bastards like you to\#deal with.
Hot damn.
The bar's lively\#today, I see.
There's even a knife\#fight over there.
Good. Was worried things\#were getting too dull around\#here.
Wish I was here\#yesterday, though.
Heard there was some\#guy tossing fire magic\#and some big oaf.
Now that's something\#I'd like to see.
Hey. Buddy. Listen.
See any... 'peculiar'\#individuals, lately?
Every goddamn day.
I've seen some men.\#Dressed in red, with\#hats and vests.
They're up to something.
I'm not sure what, but\#they've been popping up,\#left and right.
Just this morning I saw a\#big one guarding the cave\#entrance by the canyon.
And you're telling me this why?
Because others need to know.
Investigate at your\#own risk, buddy.
I've seen them\#packing heat, too.
Whatever it is they're hiding,\#they're making sure\#nobody gets near it.
They're settling a dispute like gentlemen.
What's up,\#cretins?
Back for\#another\#thrashing?
Bring it on.
We don't want trouble.
Some clowns\#just don't learn...
That's what\#I thought!
Go back to\#your hole and\#cry like the\#wimps you are!
So are you\#two goons the\#ones who beat Dale?
Hehe...
O\.o\.o\.u\.u\.uch...
MEHa-ha!\| Cowards!
You call that a fight?
I've had better fights\#with my bowels than\#that pathetic scuffle!
Now get out of my sight!
Smooth...
Look.
I don't want trouble.
I just want smokes.
This crow looks drunk as shit.
This is the life.
Traveling from place to place.
Nothing holding us down.
Laughing at pathetic losers\#like you with my buds.
I wouldn't trade it\#for the world.
What you doing here\#anyways?
J-
Hold on. Could\#you speak up?
I can't hear you over\#how little I care.
Hehehe.
I feel I'm losing\#my skill...
Pssst... old man.
Don't just close to me.
Fetch me something\#to eat.
Like Mystery Jerky.
I'll give you\#a cool looking card\#for it.
\nblt{\I[453]Ace of Spades}Double up or quit,\#the devil does splits. (Barter item)

You got an Ace of Spades!
With food this good\#I'll sure win.
Shut up.
Oh yeah, sorry.
You got what\#you wanted.
Now beat it.
Hey man...
I'll give you\#a good drink if\#you pass me an\#ace of spades...
It...
You passed him an Ace of Spades.
He gave you an Olathian Whiskey.
You motherfucker...
I know.
I'm sure having a\#a little setback right now...
But I'll pull\#through...
An Exclusive Cigar!
Respect these halls, old man.
They may not seem\#like much to an outsider,\#but to us it's our home.
So no funny business.
Understand?
Understood.
Normally Steve watches\#over the entrance to the\#Master, but he's on the john\#right now so I'm filling for him.
I'm surprised the bathroom\#door hinges stayed on with\#how fast Steve came out\#the second he was called.
How does he manage\#to be so goddamn energetic\#all the time?
Dude does push ups\#in his sleep for\#gods sake...
Also, uh, good work\#on learning dodge,\#there...\| n' stuff.
Sorry, I only know\#how to be intimidating\#to new faces.
After proper introductions\#I'm not sure what else\#to do...
OCCUPIEDGODDAMNIT.
Welcome to the Halls\#of the Gatormen.
Why's your "Password"\#so goddamn convoluted?
Well. Can't exactly guess\#your way in with a password\#like ours,\. can you?
Anyways, you staying long?
I don't even know\#who you guys are.
Some guy fought me\#and rambled your\#password.
Figured I'd see\#what the big deal\#was.
Ah, well. We're\#the Gatormen.
That guy was Crocco.
He's an ass.
He gave you the password\#cause' he considered you\#worthy of our teachings.
We seek to improve\#ourselves both physically\#and mentally by examining the\#apex predator, the alligator.
If you want to learn a new\#trick or two, talk to the\#Master. He's the greatest\#of us all.
I admit, I'm not the\#best at combat myself.
So I just do my\#best to help out\#around.
Watch the door. \|Clean the\#halls. \|Pick up dry cleaning.\#\|That sort of thing.
I could hear Steve's energetic\#battle cries from across\#the country.
You two did a\#little training,\| eh?
You can stay and continue\#to train with us, if you want.
Sticking with a gang\#was never my thing.
I can respect that.
Well you're always\#welcome back here\#if you need us.
Rough world out there.
But like the gator,\#we must learn\#toughen through\#the worst of it.
Peace out, fellas.
Salutations.
Welcome to\#my humble\#little shop.
Sell anything hard?
Why, I only\#sell the finest\#melons and fish\#around, my friend!
Well... actually\#the Melons\#aren't for sale\#anymore.
Not ever\#since this one\#gent learned how\#to weaponize them.
But the fish\#is still for sale!
Swim the river\#of life upstream to\#happiness, friend.
Fear not, friend,\#I ain't going\#nowhere any\#time soon!
Swim the river\#of life upstream to\#happiness, my\#wasted friend.
I'm still fishing.
Whe-e-en the night comes down,
I'm here all aloo-one!
there's nowhere to go.
Hey you. Listen here.
Listen
There's a monster\#out there. A Mud Man.
Son of a bitch killed\#my brother a while back.
And I'll reward anyone\#who takes him down.
He only comes out at night,\#so this'll be your only chance\#to take him down.
Yeahsurewecandothatproblably...
...That works for me.
Bring me evidence you\#killed him and the reward is yours.
Good luck.
He's probably skulking\#around the swamps.
Doing...\| whatever\#it is mud monsters do.
Show the Monster Eye?
Hey I think we killed that\#mud man guy you talked about?
Bullshit. How did guys like YOU\. kill-\^
You gave him the Monstrous Eye.
Huh...
Guess my brother was\#a bigger pushover than I thought\#if losers like you took him down...
Well a deal's a deal.
Here's what I can offer you.\#I'm only offering you\#one of em' though.

No. It's back\#the way you\#came, actually.

ALRIGHT. Thanks, man.

That's enough of this nonsense.
You okay, Elton?
I'll take\#that as\#a yes.
I'm so...\.\.\#f-\.fuckin' tired.

Guys, leave me alone.\#I'm busy.
Why?..
MmmmMM...
Why would you wake me up?
I finally get to have a good nights sleep\#and you just walk on over here and ruin it.
So why?
I thought you're

Get up,\#dead men!
The bar\#is closing.
You two better\#head on out.
No-no-no-no!\#Not from there, Elton!
Elton, listen.\.\#Walk through\#the door\#behind you.
Door's that way.
Nothing compares to\#a beer that tastes like a\#bittersweet defeat.
Hey, man,\#you got any\#magazines?
Nah?
I need them\#more than ever\#now!
HAPPINESS:
People don't know\#what they want anymore.
I'm not sure myself\#what I want anymore.
We'll find distractions\#and other fun things to\#help. But they don't matter\#in the end.
None of this matters.
I'm sorry, see next\#hint for for better\#information.
-Terry
HAPPINESS II:
The rest of the hint is torn off.
I hate Hints.
I spent all my\#mags on that\#damn machine...
All of it!
And when I kicked\#the thing in rage...
A hand came out of\#it and TRIED TO\#SHOOT ME.
What is going on\#in this shit hole?!
My mom was right.
I always will be\#a dirt eating\#loser...
Are you one of those 'agents'?
Are you heading to the base?
Yes we're heading to\#your goddamn base\#in the middle of goddamn\#nowhere.
Where else would\#we be goddamn\#going?
...well, you don't have\#to be rude about it..
The Syndicate State Guard\#has your best interest\#in mind.
Insubordination will\#not be tolerated.
Go against them at\#your own volition.
-Marvin Thornton
You found something in the bag...
A chair...?
Gentlemen!
Behold the amazing...

JAMES GOD!
Who are you?
And what do you want?
Call me God.
James God.
I'm the wrestling star.
All other wrestlers\#in Olathe couldn't handle me.
I've beaten 'em all...
So,
What do you\#want from us,\#James..?
GOD!
I TOLD YOU,\#I'M JAMES GOD!
Uuuuhh...
We're leaving, okay?
Not too fast...
I have a trick for\#you!
MY CARDINAL TRICK!
HERE I COME!
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE!
What's the matter,\#Grandpa?
You wanna make\#me your enemy?
So let it be...
Oh, come on!..
That's not fair!
Come back here!
Cook.
What the hell are\#you babbling about?
It's the password.
The super secret password\#to become the true warrior.
Oh.
Elton learned the super secret password!
That guy in dirty\#clothes and red-blue glasses...
Flint Coda?
Yeah! Flint.
I haven't seen that guy and his\#bondmen since yesterday.
Where are they?
Probably moved from there.
Hmm... too bad, too bad.
I guess this tent is free now.
Nah. We'd better wait for\#Flint to return.
Maybe he's on a\#bender again.
Yeah you're right.
That grunt with mags...
Stay away from him.
He took everything I had.
If only that bastard\#choked on with them!
I didn't need them anyways!
I wish I was at\#Ironton Town...\|\#right now...
BEH!
I want those\#Dangerous too\#glasses...
They would...\#Look good on me.

Hello.
My name is Chuck Norris.\|\|

Wait. No. It wasn't Chuck Norris.
It was...
My name is Chucke Norinsky.
My name is Chucke Norinsky...
And I...
I forgot what\#I wanted to say...

State Manuel Pages 5 and 6!
Added to Elton's Journal.
It's a magazine...
covered in blood...
Your party feels stressed now.
Damned be the day when my\#sidekick and I bought this car!
The motor has broken, the wheels\#got holed, the front passenger seat,\#on which I was setting, ejected somehow.
And all in one swoop!
And now we're ought to fix it!
AA-a-ARGH!
Poor bastard...

Given to those who\#do not repay their debts\#to the Gypsies'.
First their eyes begin to\#bleed and before long\#they explode!
Then their organs are\#vomited right out of their\#body and they bleed out\#their...\| you know.
It's a horrific sight to behold.
Sounds like a load of shit.
It's all true, I tell you.
I've seen it with my\#own two eyes.
No one ever believes me...
Not until it's too late...
The corpse's holding a\#paper with a death grip.
It's the same poster Berny gave you.
A cold chill ran down Elton's spine.
Man I miss my Harley.
Some ass wipe stole\#it during the black\#out and now I gotta\#walk everywhere again.
This blows so hard.
Hell, I'd settle\#for like a tricycle\#or something at\#this point.
My feet are killing me.
A magazine!
